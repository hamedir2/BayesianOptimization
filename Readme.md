BioAutomata

This project includes the software packages used to perform the analysis explained in the publication below:

Towards a fully automated algorithm driven platform for biosystems design
Mohammad HamediRad, Ran Chao, Scott Weisberg, Jiazhang Lian, Saurabh Sinha and Huimin Zhao

This is NOT a stand-alone code and was used to run the Spearmint program previously developed by Jasper Snoek and co-workers.

Spearmint is a package to perform Bayesian optimization according to the algorithms outlined in the paper:

Practical Bayesian Optimization of Machine Learning Algorithms
Jasper Snoek, Hugo Larochelle and Ryan P. Adams
Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2012


The code was entirely adopted from https://github.com/JasperSnoek/spearmint
